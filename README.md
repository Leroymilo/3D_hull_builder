# 3D_hull_builder
A showcase of a 3 dimensionnal convex hull algorithm I made based on Jarvis's 2D hull algorithm.


Everything should be in settings.exe . There are some extra features unlocked by uncommenting some code if you can read it.
It's not commented properly but names should be explicit enough, good luck.


Update : you can now choose the format in which the result is saved and you can choose the resolution !
I recommend having a square resolution because matplotlib will limit the plot in a square anyway.


Settings warnings to avoid a rendering time over 1 minute (approximately) for a resolution of 800x800 :

DoA = 3 -> N < 25

DoA = 2 -> N < 100

DoA = 1 -> N < 600
