detail of the animation (DoA) (integer between 0 and 3 included) : 2
number of points (N) (integer) : 50
search type ('BFS' or 'DFS') : BFS
name of result (extension is .avi, .mp4 or .gif) : result.gif
resolution (width, height in hundreds of pxls) : 8, 8

Be aware that having to many points and a detail of animation of 2 or 3 and/or high resolution will significantly lengthen render time.
If the detail of animation is set to 0, there will be no video created.
Search type only matters if there's an animation.
