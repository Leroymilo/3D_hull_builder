detail of the animation (DoA) (integer between 0 and 3 included) : 2
number of points (N) (integer) : 100
search type ('BFS' or 'DFS') : DFS
name of result : mygif

Be aware that having to many points and a detail of animation of 2 or 3 will significantly lengthen render time.
If the detail of animation is set to 0, there will be no Gif created.
search type only matters if there's an animation.
recommendation (render around 1 minute) : 
DoA 3 -> N < 25
DoA 2 -> N < 100
DoA 1 -> N < 1300
